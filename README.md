# StudioManagerV2
Update of my previous studiomanager, which was a tool I made for my sister. (Private due to sensitive data).
This will be a project where I learn to work with NodeJS and Express as I go. Setting the Studio Manager up as a server side service over having it as a clientside application.  
Allowing for multiplatform clients and separated useraccess.
